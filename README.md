#Data Preparation
-The data was prepared by insepcting the data, removing any undesired data. The days that had no data for precipatation on a certain day was calculated by finding the mean of that day in other years. The data from St. Louis was cleaned to only include the data from 2018 and above and only from one satelite. The Seattle and St. Louis data was then combinded together to create one dataset.

-The file in the dataset that does the data preparation is .

-The clean data file is clean_seattle_stl_weather.csv.
