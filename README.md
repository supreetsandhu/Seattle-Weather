# Weather in Seattle
  
This is a project that contains information and data about seattle weather. There are two files in the project. One file seattle_rain.csv about rain in seattle.
The other file is stl_rain.csv and this is about rain in St. Louis, MO. This data was collected from this source: https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-3320



# Data Preparation
-The data was prepared by insepcting the data, removing any undesired data. The days that had no data for precipatation on a certain day was calculated by finding the mean of that day in other years. The data from St. Louis was cleaned to only include the data from 2018 and above and only from one satelite. The Seattle and St. Louis data was then combinded together to create one dataset.

-The file in the dataset that does the data preparation is DATA_3320_Seattle_St_Louis_Data_Preparation.ipynb.

-The clean data file is clean_seattle_stl_weather.csv.

# Data Analysis
-The data was used from the clean_seattle_stl.csv to draw conclusions about what city has more rainy days and on the days that it rains, what city has harder rainy days such as more rainfall on those days.

-The graphs that were made also compare the different months in both cities and how different months can effect how rainy the city is.
